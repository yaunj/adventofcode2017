    "# Day 21: Fractal Art\n",
    "\n",
    "You find a program trying to generate some art. It uses a strange process that involves repeatedly enhancing the detail of an image through a set of rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image consists of a two-dimensional square grid of pixels that are either on (`#`) or off (`.`). The program always begins with this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "    .#.\n",
    "    ..#\n",
    "    ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the pattern is both `3` pixels wide and `3` pixels tall, it is said to have a *size* of `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the program repeats the following process:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the size is evenly divisible by `2`, break the pixels up into `2x2` squares, and convert each `2x2` square into a `3x3` square by following the corresponding *enhancement rule*.\n",
    "* Otherwise, the size is evenly divisible by `3`; break the pixels up into `3x3` squares, and convert each `3x3` square into a `4x4` square by following the corresponding *enhancement rule*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because each square of pixels is replaced by a larger one, the image gains pixels and so its *size* increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The artist's book of enhancement rules is nearby (your puzzle input); however, it seems to be missing rules. The artist explains that sometimes, one must *rotate* or *flip* the input pattern to find a match. (Never rotate or flip the output pattern, though.) Each pattern is written concisely: rows are listed as single units, ordered top-down, and separated by slashes. For example, the following rules correspond to the adjacent patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ../.#  =  ..\n",
    "              .#\n",
    "    \n",
    "                    .#.\n",
    "    .#./..#/###  =  ..#\n",
    "                    ###\n",
    "    \n",
    "                            #..#\n",
    "    #..#/..../#..#/.##.  =  ....\n",
    "                            #..#\n",
    "                            .##.\n",
    "\n",
    "When searching for a rule to use, rotate and flip the pattern as necessary. For example, all of the following patterns match the same rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "    .#.   .#.   #..   ###\n",
    "    ..#   #..   #.#   ..#\n",
    "    ###   ###   ##.   .#.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the book contained the following two rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ../.# => ##./#../...\n",
    "    .#./..#/### => #..#/..../..../#..#\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, the program begins with this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "    .#.\n",
    "    ..#\n",
    "    ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the grid (`3`) is not divisible by `2`, but it is divisible by `3`. It divides evenly into a single square; the square matches the second rule, which produces:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #..#\n",
    "    ....\n",
    "    ....\n",
    "    #..#\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of this enhanced grid (`4`) is evenly divisible by `2`, so that rule is used. It divides evenly into four squares:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #.|.#\n",
    "    ..|..\n",
    "    --+--\n",
    "    ..|..\n",
    "    #.|.#\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these squares matches the same rule (`../.# => ##./#../...`), three of which require some flipping and rotation to line up with the rule. The output for the rule is the same in all four cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ##.|##.\n",
    "    #..|#..\n",
    "    ...|...\n",
    "    ---+---\n",
    "    ##.|##.\n",
    "    #..|#..\n",
    "    ...|...\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the squares are joined into a new grid:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ##.##.\n",
    "    #..#..\n",
    "    ......\n",
    "    ##.##.\n",
    "    #..#..\n",
    "    ......\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, after `2` iterations, the grid contains `12` pixels that are *on*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How many pixels stay on* after `5` iterations?\n"
