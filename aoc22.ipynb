    "# Day 22: Sporifica Virus\n",
    "\n",
    "Diagnostics indicate that the local *grid computing cluster* has been contaminated with the *Sporifica Virus*. The grid computing cluster is a seemingly-infinite two-dimensional grid of compute nodes. Each node is either *clean* or *infected* by the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "To [prevent overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm#The_mistake) the nodes (which would render them useless to the virus) or detection by system administrators, exactly one *virus carrier* moves through the network, infecting or cleaning nodes as it moves. The virus carrier is always located on a single node in the network (the *current node*) and keeps track of the *direction* it is facing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid detection, the virus carrier works in bursts; in each burst, it *wakes up*, does some *work*, and goes back to *sleep*. The following steps are all executed *in order* one time each burst:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the *current node* is *infected*, it turns to its *right*. Otherwise, it turns to its *left*. (Turning is done in-place; the *current node* does not change.)\n",
    "* If the *current node* is *clean*, it becomes *infected*. Otherwise, it becomes *cleaned*. (This is done *after* the node is considered for the purposes of changing direction.)\n",
    "* The virus carrier [moves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vj37yeQQHg) *forward* one node in the direction it is facing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diagnostics have also provided a *map of the node infection status* (your puzzle input). *Clean* nodes are shown as `.`; *infected* nodes are shown as `#`. This map only shows the center of the grid; there are many more nodes beyond those shown, but none of them are currently infected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The virus carrier begins in the middle of the map facing *up*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you are given a map like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ..#\n",
    "    #..\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the middle of the infinite grid looks like this, with the virus carrier's position marked with `[ ]`:\n",
